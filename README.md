[my notes](https://github.com/NaPoGenMo/NaPoGenMo2016/issues/3)


So, I've been looking at the [Lexeduct code](https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/Lexeduct/) that Chris Pressey started last year. I didn't look into it enough at the time, and my work with it was at cross-currents to its ideology (my work last year was in the `gh-pages` branch, and "worked", even though it doesn't fit the main model in the master branch).

I think wrangling that understanding and applying it to want I currently want to do will be too time-consuming (although profitable).

So, I'm going to do the Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work.

1. static text generator posts to Tumblr
1. text generator becomes non-static
1. elaborate and iterate on step 2
1. end-goal includes ingestion of source material from online news
